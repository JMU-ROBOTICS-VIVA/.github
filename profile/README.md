# Introduction to Autonomous Robotics

## Introduction
This respository holds projects and other learning material targetted for an undergraduate level
class on introducing autonomous robotics.  It corresponds with a developed course
at James Madision University (CS 354) and the book *Just Enough Robotics* by Nathan Sprague.

Listed below are the general topics covered by the book/course and a brief description 
of the corresponding respositories to support that material.

Most of these projects incorporate the use of [ROS](ros.org) (Robot Operating System) and have
been tested using the ROS2 Foxy release.

## PID (Proportional, Inverse, Derivative) Controllers
* **PID_Practice** - Activity for learning about PID parameters and how to pass in ROS2 
parameters and launch file.  This includes a rocket visualization where the PID controller 
job is to make the rocket climb and maintain a specific altitude.
